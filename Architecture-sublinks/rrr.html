    <h2>Social Housing Redevelopment</h2>
    <br>
    <p3>Barkly Street Social Housing is a 12 story
building that currently houses 216 different
tenants from lower socio-economic
backgrounds. Targeted at housing a mainly
older demographic with a wide array of
different needs, the building currently
offers two elevators that service the whole
building, laundry facilities located on each
floor, a garbage room that connects to a
garbage chute that runs throughout the
whole builing and emergency buzzers
equipped in every unit to alert neighbours of
any ongoing emergencies.
<br>
<br>
Currently, the building is planned to be
demolished due to the building not meeting
modern living standard combined with
its outdated ammenities and thermal
performance and is intended to be replaced
with modern facilities in its place.
<br>
<br>
Our proposal looks to challenge this
approach through instead suggesting a
Retrofit and Infil approach to revitalising
the towers in order to preserve pre existing
communities within the building and to
reduce the potential displacement of
residents during construction of the new
buildings.
<br>
<br>
Strategies that could be implemented within
the building to enhance both its functional
use and its energy performance in lieu of a
complete demolition include the installation
of a new facade element to attatch onto the
pre-existing concrete structure to increase
space within the apartments, increasing
the livibility within the building as well as
reducing fuel poverty through upgrading
thermal insulation within the building as
well as installing triple glazed windows and
upgraded insulation to decrease operation
costs of the building which could cut costs
for the residents and offset the cost of
these proposed additions.
<br>
<br>
Other strategies to improve the sense of
safety and community within the building
would be to promote the idea of ‘micro
communities’ through improving elevators
within the structure to lock out residents
to particular floors and improving lines of
sight within public areas such as corridors
and ammenity rooms such as the laundry
room and garbage areas to encourage
residents to look out for each other. Nooks
and crannies within the building will also look
to be repurposed with a particular activity to
improve safety and the ground floor will also
be revitalised to allow a communal place
to meet other residents without having to
open personal units to facilitate this type of
communication.</p3>
